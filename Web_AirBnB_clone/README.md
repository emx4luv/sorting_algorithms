# AirBnB clone
This is a project about creating the first part of a clone of AirBnB.
We built a command interpreter that manages AirBnB objects, created a class that takes care of intialization, serialization and deserialization.
We built a storage engine that facilitates the storage of JSON strings so that they may be deserialized and brought back as objects.
We built unnittests to validate our classes and storage engine.

To run the AirBnB command interpreter in interactive mode simply run the console.py file, ex. './console.py'.
Once in interactive mode you can use commands.

To run the AirBnB command interpreter in non-interactive mode, 'echo' the command you wish you use and pipe it into running the console.py file. 
ex. echo "help" | ./console.py
